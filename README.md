A 2-Dimensional recreation of the popular MMORPG RuneScape

## Maps

There's a desperate need for more maps. If you want to contribute, please download [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) and use that to make your maps. The standard tileset is included in this project. Feel free to add tiles to the tileset as necessary. Please try to make the maps as accurate as possible, but don't worry if things get a little skewed.

## Todo

In no particular order, major items only:
- Add object and NPC layers
- Object interaction
- Add inventory, etc. interfaces
- System messages
- More maps
- Minimap
